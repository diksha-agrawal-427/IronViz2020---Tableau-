# IronViz2020 - Tableau
While being busy with my Masters and job hunting, I rely more on ready to eat or frozen food nowadays. So, I thought of exploring the nutritional fact of my food by participating in the #ironviz competition which has a theme of Health and Wellness this year.

Key insights from this dataset are:
*Sea food has the highest nutrition, especially Salmon.
*To have a proper nutritional diet one can choose a diet combo of "Fruits and Sea food" or "Fruits and Vegetables".
